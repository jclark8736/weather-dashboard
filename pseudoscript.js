// # 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

// ## Your Task

// Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

// Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

// ## User Story

// ```
// AS A traveler
// I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
// SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
// ```

// ## Acceptance Criteria

// ```
// GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
// WHEN I search for a city
// THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
// WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
// THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
// WHEN I view the UV indexfd
// THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
// ```

// ## Mock-Up

// The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

// ![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta.](./Assets/06-server-side-apis-homework-demo.png)
